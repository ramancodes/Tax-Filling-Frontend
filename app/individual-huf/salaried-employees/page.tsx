                    The Finance Act 2024 has amended the provisions of Section 115BAC w.e.f AY 2024-25 to make new tax regime the default tax regime for the assessee being an Individual, HUF, AOP (not being co-operative societies), BOI or Artificial Juridical Person. 
                    However, the eligible taxpayers have the option to opt out of new tax regime and choose to be taxed under old tax regime. 
                    The old tax regime refers to the system of income tax calculation and slabs that existed before the introduction of the new tax regime. 
                    In the old tax regime, taxpayers have the option to claim various tax deductions and exemptions. 
                    <br /><br />

                    In "non-business cases", option to choose the regime can be exercised every year directly in the ITR to be filed on or before the due date specified under section 139(1). 
                    <br /><br />
                    
                    In case of eligible taxpayers having income from business and profession, new tax regime is default regime. If assessee wants to opt out of new tax regime, they can furnish Form-10-IEA on or before the due date u/s 139(1) for furnishing the return of income. Also, for the purpose of withdrawal of such option i.e. opting out of old tax regime shall also be done by way of furnishing Form No.10-IEA. However, option to switch to old tax regime and withdraw the option in any subsequent AY  is available only once in lifetime for eligible taxpayers having income from business and profession.
